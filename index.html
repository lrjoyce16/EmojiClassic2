} <style="font-size:100px; font-family:Indie Flower; color:#00ff00;"> My name is Lilia Joyce. Im a sophmore Sport Communication major at Coastal Carolina University. I was previously on the Women's Golf Team, then opted to just do social media for the team instead, like more of a team manager role. My dream job in the feature is to work in the golf social media industry. With this in mind, I decided it was best that I get my priorities straight and do more of what I enjoy. next semester I will be working for the Digital Media team here at Coastal and hopefully attend an intership over the summer to add to my experience.</p>
